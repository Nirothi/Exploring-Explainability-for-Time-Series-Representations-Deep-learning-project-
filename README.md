## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the 02456 Deep Learning 2023 project titled "Exploring Explainability for Time Series Representations." This project aims to investigate and enhance the interpretability of time series representations generated by deep learning models, specifically VGGish.

## Project Components

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analyses for our deep learning experiments. This notebook covers the various aspects of the project, including RELAX method and explainability techniques.

## Reference Paper

Our work is inspired by the paper titled RELAX: Representation Learning Explainability.
